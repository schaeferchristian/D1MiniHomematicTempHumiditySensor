# Measuring Temperature and Humidity the cheap way

Buying preassembled products is not always the most fun. That's why I built this humidity temperature device myself and let it post to Homematic.

To give you an idea about the total costs and which parts you need:

* The Wemos D1 Mini Arduino compatible board that brings WIFI out of the box    ~5€ e.g. at [BerryBase.de](https://www.berrybase.de/raspberry-pi-co/esp8266-esp32/d1-mini-esp8266-entwicklungsboard)
* DHT22 Digital Humidity and Temperature-Sensor                                 ~4€ e.g at [BerryBase.de](https://www.berrybase.de/raspberry-pi-co/raspberry-pi/bauelemente/dht22-digitaler-temperatur-und-luftfeuchtesensor)
* 10 kOhm resistor

You see in total it is less then 10€
